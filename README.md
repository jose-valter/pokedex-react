# Simple Pokédex app created with React v18 & Vite

## Project orinally created by @manualdodev.

### From the pokémon 650 (Chespin) forward, no animated images were available. The only alternative was to add a static image. Also, some names were too long so I had to use slice() to reduce the length. I also made some small changes but they were not relevant for me to write here.

### All types of contributions are welcome and appreciated (:
